                        If you are frightened, <span class="mechanic">ability power rolls</span> you make against the <span class="mechanic">source</span> of your fear take a <span class="highlight">bane</span>. If that source is a creature, <span class="mechanic">their ability power rolls against you</span> gain an <span class="highlight">edge</span>. You <span class="mechanic">can't</span> willingly <span class="mechanic">move closer</span> to the source of your fear if you know the location of that source. If you gain the frightened condition from one source while already frightened by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.

                        While you are grabbed, your <span class="mechanic">speed</span> is <span class="highlight">0</span>, you can't <span class="mechanic">be force moved</span>, you <span class="mechanic">can't use the Knockback maneuver</span>, and you take a <span class="highlight">bane</span> on <span class="mechanic">abilities</span> that don't target the creature grabbing you. If the creature grabbing you moves, they bring you with them. If the creature's size is equal to or less than yours, their speed is halved while they have you grabbed.
                        <br><br>
                        The creature grabbing you can use a maneuver to move you into an unoccupied space adjacent to them. The creature grabbing you can end the grab at any time (no action required). You can also attempt to escape being grabbed using the Escape Grab maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat). If you teleport or if the creature grabbing you is force moved to a space that isn't adjacent to you, you are no longer grabbed.

You must crawl to move along the ground, which costs you <span class="highlight">1 additional</span> square of <span class="mechanic">movement</span> for every square you crawl. You can't climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If you are climbing, flying, or jumping while you are knocked prone, you fall.
                        <br><br>
                        While prone, you can stand up as a maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat), unless the ability or effect that imposed the condition says otherwise. You can use a maneuver to make an adjacent prone creature stand up.
