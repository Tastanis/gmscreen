# Combat Tracker UI Test Notes

- [ ] GM view exposes add/remove combatant controls and turn advancement buttons.
- [ ] Player view hides mutating controls and reflects updates after polling.
- [ ] Linking a combatant to a token pre-fills portrait/name data.
- [ ] Condition manager opens from initiative list and displays tooltips on hover.
- [ ] Tracker layout adapts between narrow sidebar and wider drawer modes.
