Students from other colleges often take Silverquill courses to improve their communication skills, learning to speak and write more effectively about their primary field of study. Silverquill and Prismari see overlap in the area of performing arts, with Silverquill emphasizing verbal performance and Prismari focusing more on dance and other forms of movement.<\/p><p>-<b>Radiance:<\/b> language is used as a light to illuminate others and make the world a brighter place, to uplift others, to shine a light on the evils of society and to inspire the best in those around them<\/p><p><b>-Shadow: <\/b>uses language to steb, expose stinging truths and to obfuscate secrets.

Its scholars view art as the fundamental form of self-expression and magic as a tool, a medium, and an inspiration. Prismari studies focus on visual arts (including architecture, painting, and sculpture) and performing arts (such as dance, music, and theater). The curriculum overlaps with Lorehold in the field of art history and with Silverquill in the literary arts, and some students divide their time between Prismari and one of those other schools to pursue these interdisciplinary fields. Prismari mages use magic to weave the elements into their creations; they might juxtapose fire alongside paint, ceramics, or fabric, or they might choreograph elaborate works that unite a dancer’s movements with gusts and eddies of air.<\/p><p><b>Perfection: <\/b>focus on technique, analysis, theory, aesthetics, and universal principals.
