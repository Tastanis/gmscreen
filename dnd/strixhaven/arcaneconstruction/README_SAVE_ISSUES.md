# Arcane Construction - Save System Issues & Fixes

## Current Save Issues Summary

### Problem Description
Text entered into grid cells was appearing in wrong locations after save/reload. Users would type text in bottom enchanting section cells, save, refresh, and find the text had moved to completely different cells.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **coordinate mapping inconsistencies** between save and load operations:

1. **Save Operation**: Text was being saved with correct cell coordinates (e.g., `cell-5-18`)
2. **Load Operation**: Text was being loaded but applied to wrong cells due to:
   - Race condition in initialization order
   - Timing issues between grid creation and data loading
   - Potential coordinate calculation mismatches

### Symptoms Observed
- Text would "jump" to different cells after refresh
- Sometimes text would persist correctly, sometimes not
- Connections (arrows) would persist but text wouldn't
- More frequent issues in bottom sections of the grid
- User reported: "sometimes stuff shows up and sometimes it doesn't"

## Recent Fixes Implemented

### 1. Initialization Order Fix (Completed)
**Problem**: `createGridStructure()` was running before `loadGridData()`
**Solution**: Made `initializeGrid()` async and ensured data loads before grid creation

```javascript
// Before (problematic)
function initializeGrid() {
    createGridStructure();
    loadGridData();
}

// After (fixed)
async function initializeGrid() {
    await loadGridData();
    createGridStructure();
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Debug Logging (Completed)
Added extensive logging to track coordinate flow:

**Save Operations**:
- Log exact coordinates being saved
- Track cell IDs and content
- Monitor save timing

**Load Operations**:
- Log coordinates being loaded from server
- Track cell assignment process
- Monitor data application timing

**Cell Creation**:
- Log cell ID generation
- Track dataset coordinate values
- Verify grid structure integrity

### 3. Save System Architecture

**GM Save** (`save_gm_data.php`):
- Saves text content and custom arrows
- Data stored in `data/gm_data.json`
- Includes authentication and file locking

**Zepha Save** (`save_zepha_data.php`):
- Saves learned skills only
- Data stored in `data/zepha_data.json`
- Separate from GM content

**Load System** (`load_shared_data.php`):
- Combines both GM and Zepha data
- Returns unified structure for both users
- Handles missing files gracefully

## Current Status

### What's Fixed
- ✅ Initialization race condition resolved
- ✅ Debug logging implemented for tracking
- ✅ Save/load endpoints properly created
- ✅ File locking system prevents conflicts
- ✅ Arrow positioning issues resolved

### Debugging Process
1. **Test the system** with new debug logging
2. **Check browser console** for coordinate tracking messages
3. **Look for patterns** in save vs load coordinates
4. **Identify timing issues** in console timestamps

### Next Steps if Issues Persist
1. **Analyze console output** to see exact coordinate flow
2. **Check for timing-related issues** between save and refresh
3. **Verify cell ID consistency** across save/load cycles
4. **Test with different browsers** to rule out browser-specific issues

## Debug Console Messages to Watch For

```
SAVE DEBUG: Saving cell content...
LOAD DEBUG: Loading data from server...
CELL CREATION: Creating cell with ID...
TIMING: Grid structure created at...
```

## Files Involved
- `js/arcaneconstruction.js` - Main logic with debug logging
- `save_gm_data.php` - GM data persistence
- `save_zepha_data.php` - Zepha data persistence  
- `load_shared_data.php` - Data loading
- `check_save_lock.php` - Conflict prevention

## Testing Protocol
1. Enter text in specific cells (note exact locations)
2. Save the data
3. Refresh the page
4. Check console for debug messages
5. Verify text appears in same cells
6. Report any coordinate mismatches found in console
