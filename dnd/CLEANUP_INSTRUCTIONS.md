## KEEP - Important Functionality (DO NOT REMOVE)

### Files with Important Changes
- `dashboard.php` - Contains all data protection and file locking improvements
- `js/character-sheet.js` - Contains new manual save system
- `css/style.css` - Contains visual indicators for unsaved changes

### Key Features to Preserve
1. **Manual Save System** - Save button that turns red when changes are made
2. **File Locking** - `LOCK_EX` flags in all file operations  
3. **Atomic Writes** - Temp file → rename pattern in `saveCharacterData()`
4. **Backup System** - Automatic backup creation before saves
5. **Data Validation** - Prevents saving empty data over real data
6. **Navigation Auto-Save** - Saves on window close and character switching

## Verification Steps After Cleanup

### 1. Test Basic Functionality
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Character data displays correctly
- [ ] Can switch between characters (GM)
- [ ] Save button works and turns red when changes are made

### 2. Test Save System
- [ ] Make a small change to a character field
- [ ] Save button turns red and shows "*"
- [ ] Click "Save All Data" button
- [ ] Data saves successfully
- [ ] Button returns to green

### 3. Test Data Protection
- [ ] Verify backup files are created in `/dnd/data/` folder
- [ ] Check that old backup files are cleaned up (only keeps 5)
- [ ] Confirm no 508 or 503 errors in browser console

### 4. Test Navigation Saves
- [ ] Make changes to a character
- [ ] Switch to different character (should auto-save)
- [ ] Try to close browser tab (should prompt if unsaved changes)

## Emergency Recovery
If anything breaks after cleanup:
1. Restore from your recent backup to `/dnd/data/characters.json`
2. All the protection systems are still in place
3. Contact support if issues persist

## What Was Fixed
- **Data Corruption** - File locking prevents race conditions
- **508 Errors** - Removed auto-save intervals and fixed recursion
- **Data Loss** - Validation prevents overwriting real data with defaults
- **User Experience** - Clear save indicators and manual control

The core functionality is now much more stable and reliable than before!
